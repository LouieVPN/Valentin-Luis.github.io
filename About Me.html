      <h3>Our Story</h3>
      <p>Hey there, I'm a 29-year-old guy who's starting a food truck because I love to cook and share my food with others. There's nothing quite like seeing the joy on someone's face when they take that first bite and realize how delicious a dish is. For me, food is about bringing people together and creating memories.</p>
      <p>I was raised by a Puerto Rican mother and grandmother who instilled in me a love of authentic food. I grew up with big meals and family gatherings as a staple in my life. I learned how to cook from them and developed a passion for creating dishes that are full of flavor and soul.</p>
      <p>Starting a food truck is a dream come true for me because it allows me to share my love of food with even more people. Whether you're craving classic Puerto Rican dishes or want to try something new, my menu is crafted with care to bring you dishes that are both delicious and memorable.</p>
